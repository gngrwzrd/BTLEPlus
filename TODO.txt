need to add logic to queue everything if the serial queue is not idle. Seems like bugs will
happen if things are allowed to be sent or received while waiting for a specific response to a control
message.
I think I can use a waitingFor[] array to keep track of what's allowed to be received. If
something is received out of order then it's ignored.

file resume logic.
Rename everything to BTLEPlus
Write a tester app to automate a complete test of every feature.
Add randmized packet loss simulation.
Fix resend from packet?
Add streaming BLEPlusSerialServiceStreamingMessage - provides and receives packets.
