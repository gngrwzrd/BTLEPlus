test request/response

If I switch packet provider and receiver to require NSFileHandle then I think I can leave it up to the user to
implement resuming of file transfers in either direction.

I think the file resume logic will need to always write to tmp files, allowing the user to concatenate them
themselves. Otherwise it'll have to be built into the serial service which is too specific to go there.

rename BLEPlusSerialServiceControllerMode to BLEPlusDeviceMode

Rename everything to BTLEPlus

Write a tester app to automate a complete test of every feature.

Add randmized packet loss simulation.

Fix resend from packet?
