Implement take turn. Currently because the timer is restarted all the time it will not allow
messages to be sent from the peer as quickly as it can. Need to only restart the timer when it
expires.

Test file transfer.

Rename everything to BTLEPlus



Write a tester app to automate a complete test of every feature.

Add randmized packet loss simulation.

implement resuming of file transfers in either direction.

Fix resend from packet?

Add streaming BLEPlusSerialServiceStreamingMessage - provides and receives packets.
Keepalive?
