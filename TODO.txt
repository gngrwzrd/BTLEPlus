I think if I unwrap as much as possible from CBPeripheral and CBCentralManager I can test them easier

Finish advertisement data tests.
Test reset
Test progress
Need to check that acceptFilter is set properly in all reset cases.
Should I add Cancel, which is basically reset as it is now?
Should Reset behave differently, maybe it only resets and starts sending current message from byte 0
Try and find as many places where I can take out optionals. Like startScanning on central manager.
File resume logic is going to have to be done by the user as there has to be a request for how many bytes the peer has, so the other peer can seek to the right position.
Add streaming BLEPlusSerialServiceStreamingMessage - provides and receives packets.
Make mtu/window size not changeable after init??

TESTS:
Add randmized packet loss simulation for resend testing.
