Implement Reset logic - I took it out to simplify for now.

For file handling, change the producer/receiver to only require file handles,
this way I can add delegate methods that return a file handle for me. This
will allow easier file resume handling and allow the user to do it themselves.

since request/response needs two types, maybe switch messageType to two bytes.
progress needs to go backwards on resend window

file resume logic.
