Can I take out discoverRequirementsCompleted in BLETPlusPeriperal?

Impement Reset

Implement mtu/windowSize peerInfo triggering when changed. ??? Maybe instaed I make it so mtu/windowSize is required at init?
changing mtu/windowSize seems like it should only happen during peer setup.

Expose bytesSent / bytesReceived on serial controller.

Wondering if I should have the delegate ask for a message to start accepting
packets, this would be much easier to delegate resume logic to the user..

rename abort to Reset which is what it actually is.
Implement Reset logic - I took it out to simplify for now.

For file handling, change the producer/receiver to only require file handles,
this way I can add delegate methods that return a file handle for me. This
will allow easier file resume handling and allow the user to do it themselves.

since request/response needs two types, maybe switch messageType to two bytes.
progress needs to go backwards on resend window

file resume logic.

Add randmized packet loss simulation for resend testing.

fix resend from packet?

Add streaming BLEPlusSerialServiceStreamingMessage - provides and receives packets.

Write a tester app to automate a complete test of every feature.
